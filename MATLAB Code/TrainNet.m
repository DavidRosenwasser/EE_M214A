function [net] = TrainNet(trainFeatures,trainLabels)
%% Description
% This function takes in the feature dictionary, training data, and test
% data and returns the ERR and the trained net. Currently using a
% feedforward net
% 
% Inputs:
%   trainFeatures: collected features for each training instance. this
%   variable is created by taking features from both speech files and
%   processing them whether it's subraction of the values, concatination,
%   etc. Expects a matrix where features from each test are contain in
%   column vectors. For example, if 10 features are collected from the two
%   input files and there are 50 tests, the matrix has a dimention of 10x50:
%       
%       size(trainFeatures) = [10 50]
%      
%   trainLabels: is a row vector containing the labels for each test. each
%   element of the row vector cooresponding with the test between the two
%   files in trainFeatures. So for the above trainFeatures the matching 
%   trainLabels is 1x50:
%
%       size(trainFeatures) = [10 50]
%
%   trainFeatures: collected features for each testing instance. this
%   variable follows the same sizing convention as trainFeatures
%
%   trainLabels: collected features for each testing instance. this
%   variable follows the same sizing convention as trainLabels  
%
% Outputs:    
%   - net: Trained neural net object trained with training data and tested
%           with the testing data to produce ERR
